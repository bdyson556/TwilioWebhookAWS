1) Make sure you have your TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN. Should be in 1Password, you should only need the value (not the key).
2) Make sure to set the environmental variable. Just do it on the command line. Try this process with GitBash or Ubuntu
terminal first.
- Linux-based terminal: export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=valuevaluevalue
- Windows-based terminal: set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=valuevaluevalue
3) Deploy the function:
- Linux: sls deploy
- Windows: serverless deploy (IMPORTANT: do NOT use "sls deploy" on a Windows-based terminal as there is a naming conflict.

Troubleshooting and Monitoring: AWS Lambda; find your func, monitor, check logs, etc. Any print statements or stacktraces
that you specify to print should show up there, in the Cloudwatch logs. Find the invocation and click on the log link.
